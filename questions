1) How to solve ODE equations of motion?  (am using 4th order kunge-kutta)
2) Do I need to concern myself with langiven equations?
3) is looking up values in a table really faster than calculation? (especially for beth friction)
4) Does elastic scattering with shielded potential change particles' energy? (I think not)
5) How to generate an elastic scattering distribution? (bin width?)
6) How to produce usefull tables for other distributions?  (perhaps cumtrapz?)
